# Achitecture_knowledge_assessment_LLM

测试题形式分为客观题和主观题。客观题选取国家一级注册建筑师考试2018-2024年模拟考题，按知识域划分为设计前期、建筑设计、建筑结构、建筑材料、建筑经济5个子模块，每个模块包括5道题，形成共25道题的标准化测试题题库（附录1）。主观题设置5类开放式图文交互任务，包括户型平面分析、工程制图符号识别、古典建筑风格解析、场地设计推理、空间要素推理（附录2）。

The test consists of two formats: objective questions and subjective questions.

Objective Questions:

These are selected from the National First-Class Architect Registration Examination simulation questions (2018–2024). The questions are categorized into five knowledge domains: Pre-Design, Architectural Design, Building Structure, Building Materials, and Architectural Economics. Each domain includes five questions, forming a standardized test question bank of 25 questions (Appendix 1).

Subjective Questions:

Five types of open-ended visual-textual interaction tasks are designed, including:

Residential Unit Floor Plan Analysis
Engineering Drawing Symbol Recognition
Classical Architectural Style Interpretation
Site Design Reasoning
Spatial Element Reasoning
(See Appendix 2 for details).
Key Translation Notes:
Structure Clarity: Maintained the hierarchical organization of the original text (e.g., bold headings for formats, bullet points for task categories).
Technical Terminology:
"国家一级注册建筑师考试" → National First-Class Architect Registration Examination (standardized title).
"知识域" → knowledge domains (academic phrasing).
"图文交互任务" → visual-textual interaction tasks (emphasizes multimodal input/output).
Consistency with Previous Translations:
Retained terms like LLMs (Large Language Models) if referenced in the broader context.
Used Appendix 1/2 for cross-referencing, aligning with academic formatting conventions.
Academic Tone: Formal phrasing (e.g., "explicitly cited," "standardized test question bank") to match scholarly writing standards.
