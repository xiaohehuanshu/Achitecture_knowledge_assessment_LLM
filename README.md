# Achitecture_knowledge_assessment_LLM

测试题形式分为客观题和主观题。客观题选取国家一级注册建筑师考试2018-2024年模拟考题，按知识域划分为设计前期、建筑设计、建筑结构、建筑材料、建筑经济5个子模块，每个模块包括5道题，形成共25道题的标准化测试题题库（附录1）。主观题设置5类开放式图文交互任务，包括户型平面分析、工程制图符号识别、古典建筑风格解析、场地设计推理、空间要素推理（附录2）。

The test is structured into two formats: objective and subjective questions. Objective questions are curated from the National First-Class Architect Registration Examination simulation questions (2018–2024). These questions are organized into five knowledge domains: Pre-Design, Architectural Design, Building Structure, Building Materials, and Architectural Economics. Each domain contains five questions, forming a standardized test question bank of 25 questions (Appendix 1). Subjective questions include five open-ended visual-textual interaction tasks, such as residential unit floor plan analysis, engineering drawing symbol recognition, classical architectural style interpretation, site design reasoning, and spatial element reasoning (Appendix 2). This framework ensures a comprehensive evaluation of both foundational knowledge and applied reasoning in architectural design, tailored for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs).
